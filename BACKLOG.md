# TODO

- [x] make the letters of the matrix style animation 50% bigger, let the letters have a green trail with a limited length that dissolves (gets gradually lighter towards the end)
- [x] the output sub-foldername is "unknown-author", it should be the name of the profile
- [x] Ctrl+f jumps to the filter input field on the browse page, it should jump to the filterinput field on the currently active page.
- [x] The post counter in the header should be updated while scanning "([scanned])" for posts and also updated when scraping posts "([scraped]/[total])"
- [x] when filtered the counter should show "([filtered]/[total])"
